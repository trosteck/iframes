<div class="indented">
<p>A person required to pay child support under an agreement or order has a legal obligation to pay the money to the recipient.</p>
<p>Child support arrears don't expire. They exist until they're paid, or until a court order reduces or cancels them.</p>
<p>If you have a legitimate reason for not being able to pay, you can apply to court to ask a judge to reduce or cancel your child support arrears. The judge will ask about your circumstances.</p>
<p>It's rare for judges to cancel child support arrears. It's more common for them to reduce or delay payment for arrears.</p>

<p>Reasons a judge might cancel or reduce arrears include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your income has been significantly reduced. (For example, you lost your job or are on social assistance.)</li>
	<li>The child has been living primarily with you while the arrears grew.</li>
	<li>The child support amounts were based on the your "imputed income", which turns out to be higher than actual income. (This could happen if you didn't provide financial information when the child support order was paid, and the court had to assign an income based on available information.)</li>
	<li>The child support arrears grew while the child no longer qualified for support. (This could happen if the child is over 19 and not financially dependent or enrolled in post-secondary studies.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Invalid reasons</h3>
<p>The judge won't reduce or cancel your arrears if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The child is over 19 now and not financially dependent. (You still owe any child support arrears that accumulated while the child was eligible for support.) </li>
	<li>You don't see the child anymore, or the other parent doesn't allow you to see the child. </li>
	<li>You weren’t aware of the order to pay child support.</li>
	<li>You stopped paying because the other parent didn't follow the rules about exchanging financial information. </li>
</ul>
